## 📌 Notes

This repository is for learning and experimentation with HTML and CSS.  
New projects will be added here as I practice more concepts, like:

- Layouts using Flexbox and Grid
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Navigation bars, sidebars, and footers
- Styling buttons, forms, and cards
- UI components like modals, tooltips, and hover effects
- Animations and transitions
